                    I have completed the Code Nation Develop Course, an intensive Level 2 course on the basics of Python. The course involved creating a terminal game in a group, as well as the basics of Python as it would be used in the workplace. <br> <br>
                    I have examples of Python coding available on my <a href="https://github.com/QwuinJ">Github</a>.<br><br>
                    Python is my favourite language so far. It has good readability, the variables and functions are easy and intuitive to program, and the indentation is beautiful. It has very few things which make me angry.

                    I am currently studying the Code Nation Master Course, an intensive Level 3 course on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Over the Develop course, I learned the basics of HTML and CSS. I have coded this website, and another which is available on my <a href="https://github.com/QwuinJ">Github</a>. <br> <br>
                    I particularly enjoyed learning CSS and frontend coding. It has been satisfying to be able to neatly format a webpage. HTML is less interesting as I learn more of what JavaScript can do, but I am still fascinated by the ability to build a webpage with it - and that it's been in use for thirty years!

                <h2 class="col-heading">JavaScript</h2>
                <p class="col-content">
                    JavaScript is the most challenging language I've learned so far. Coming from Python, I've struggled to grasp the amount of semi-colons and curly brackets that seem to be a mainstay of JavaScript. Nonetheless, I persevere. <br> <br>
                    I have been studying JavaScript on the Code Nation courses, and can see many useful applications for it when creating websites. I have not used JavaScript so far on this website, but I do have examples of it on my <a href="https://github.com/QwuinJ">Github</a>.
