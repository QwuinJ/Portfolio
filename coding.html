                    I have completed the Code Nation Develop Course, an intensive Level 2 course on the basics of Python. The course involved creating a terminal game in a group, as well as the basics of Python as it would be used in the workplace. <br> <br>
                    I have examples of Python coding available on my <a href="https://github.com/QwuinJ">Github</a>.<br><br>
                    Python is my favourite language so far. It has good readability, the variables and functions are easy and intuitive to program, and the indentation is beautiful.

                    I am currently studying the Code Nation Master Course, an intensive Level 3 course on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Over the Develop course, I learned the basics of HTML and CSS. I have coded this website, and another which is available on my <a href="https://github.com/QwuinJ">Github</a>. <br> <br>
                    I particularly enjoyed learning CSS and frontend coding. It has been satisfying to be able to neatly format a webpage. For this website, I was experimenting with using flexbox to create a mobile-first dynamic website. I've also enjoyed creating websites from scratch using HTML.

                <h2 class="col-heading">JavaScript</h2>
                <p class="col-content">
                    JavaScript is the most challenging language I've learned so far. It took a while to get into the proper formatting. However, I have enjoyed it's ability to make web design much more easy and interesting. <br> <br>
                    I have been studying JavaScript on the Code Nation courses, and can see many useful applications for it when creating websites. I have not used JavaScript so far on this website, but I do have examples of it on my <a href="https://github.com/QwuinJ">Github</a>.
