# Portfolio

This is my portfolio website created in the second week of the CN Master Course.

Structure:
The website is structured using HTML elements, including a header, a main element, nav bar, and a footer.

Design:
When designing the website I worked to make it first usable on mobile phones. 
I then used media queries to change the layout if the screen is over a certain width.
I set the entire site to be inside one flex container, then divided the content into further flex containers and boxes.
On the homepage I created a hero container with three boxes, all of which have background images provided through the CSS.
I also included a test image (of my cat), which was embedded using HTML, as well as links to my LinkedIn and Github. 
In the hero image, I included a subtle animation which zooms in on the boxes when they are hovered over.
I also used an animation in the nav bar to change the background colour on hovering. 

Thoughts:
My main issue with my other website was that it was not mobile compatible. 
I feel that I've adressed that well here, and learned some useful skills with using media queries. 
I found the images for the hero boxes on Pexels, and the colour scheme was found on canva.com.
The main issue I had was with the CSS finding the background images within the repository. 
It turned out to be an issue with the file paths.
In terms of content the site is a bit bare. 

Next steps:
I would like to fill in or rewrite some of the content, and include examples of my coding.
Having looked at other websites, I am considering changing the layout to have a static nav bar/ top-bar, without a header.
I would like to include some more functionality to the website, such as a drop-down menu / disappearing sidebar.
I would also like to create a dark-mode / light-mode for the site.
